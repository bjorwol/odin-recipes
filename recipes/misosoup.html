    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>ugh... miso soup. you know when you go to a japanese restaurant and they come out with miso soup before your appetizers + ontrays? tbh, that's my favorite part. miso soup is calming, delightful, and heartwarming. it's also very easy to make.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Dashi packet (Japanese soup stock)</li>
            <li>6 ounces thickly sliced guanciale, pancetta, or slab bacon, cut into 1/4-inch (6-mm) cubes</li>
            <li>Miso Paste</li>
            <li>Tofu</li>
            <li>Dried wakame seaweed</li>
            <li>Green onions (chopped)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make Dashi</strong>: Just like brewing tea, you steep the packet in hot water for a couple of minutes, and you’re left with a flavorful broth that’s surprisingly close to homemade.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Miso Paste</strong>: When you add miso paste, turn off the heat before adding miso paste to avoid accidentally boiling the soup. Always dissolve the miso paste in a ladle or separate bowl—never add it directly to the soup—to avoid big clumps left in the soup.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Tofu to the Soup</strong>: To avoid breaking the tofu, always add it after dissolving the miso paste. This helps keep the tofu intact and ensures a smoother texture in your soup. Since tofu doesn’t require cooking, you just need to warm it up. For miso soup, cut tofu into ½-inch (1.3 cm) cubes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Dried Wakame and Green Onion</strong>: Along with tofu, add dried wakame and green onions at the same time. Serve miso soup immediately while it’s warm.</li>
    </ol>
