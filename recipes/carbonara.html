    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>6 ounces thickly sliced guanciale, pancetta, or slab bacon, cut into 1/4-inch (6-mm) cubes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
            <li>3 large eggs plus 1 large egg yolk, well beaten</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, combined with 1/4 cup grated pecorino Romano</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Grab your largest skillet and place it over medium heat. Pour in the olive oil and wait for it to ripple.</li>
        <li>Toss in the guanciale (or pancetta or bacon) and cook, stirring often, until crisp. Slide the skillet off the heat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large pot, bring 6 quarts of water to a boil. Add the salt and spaghetti and cook, stirring to prevent the strands from clumping, until al dente.</li>
        <li>Working quickly, grab big bunches of cooked spaghetti with tongs and add them to the skillet with the guanciale.</li>
        <li>Immediately add the eggs and half the cheese to the skillet and toss well. If the dish isn't as creamy as you'd like, add a small ladleful of the cooking water.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle generously with pepper and serve at once. Pass the remaining cheese at the table.</li>
    </ol>
